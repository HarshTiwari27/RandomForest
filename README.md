# RandomForest Project

This repository contains comprehensive implementations of Random Forest models, demonstrating their application in classification, regression, and hyperparameter tuning. Each implementation is provided in Jupyter Notebooks, making it easier to understand, modify, and execute step-by-step. The notebooks include detailed explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to help users grasp the concepts of Random Forest algorithms and their practical usage.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd RandomForest-main
   ```
2. Install general dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install additional dependencies as needed from the subdirectories (`classification/`, `regression/`, `tuning/`).

## Usage
- Open Jupyter Notebook:
  ```sh
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Navigate to the desired notebook in the `classification/`, `regression/`, or `tuning/` folder.
- Run the notebook cells to execute the Random Forest models.
